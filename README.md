# NLP Solution for Customer Feedback Analysis

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack Natural Language Processing (NLP) application designed to automatically interpret, categorize, and analyze customer feedback. The system uses advanced deep learning techniques to extract key insights and sentiment from unstructured text data, providing actionable intelligence to help a business make better-informed decisions.

This project showcases a blend of **deep learning expertise**, **backend software development**, and the ability to solve a real-world business problem with a data-driven approach.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network built with TensorFlow to accurately classify customer sentiment from text.
- **RESTful API:** A robust backend API developed with **Python (Flask)** that handles and processes large volumes of text data via simple HTTP requests.
- **Data Interpretation:** Utilizes a variety of analytical and machine learning techniques to extract and interpret complex data, such as identifying key themes and sentiment.
- **Scalable Architecture:** The separation of the model and API allows for easy scaling and integration into larger applications or systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, Flask, Pandas, NumPy
- **API Development:** REST API
- **Data Handling:** JSON

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nlp-feedback-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/nlp-feedback-system.git)
    cd nlp-feedback-system
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Flask API:**
    ```bash
    python app/api.py
    ```
    The API will run locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

4.  **Test the API with a POST request** (e.g., using `curl` or Postman):
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "The product is great, but the customer service was a bit slow."}' [http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict_sentiment](http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict_sentiment)
    ```

## Data Source

This project can be trained on any large text classification dataset. Recommended public datasets include the **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset** or the **Amazon Product Reviews Dataset**.
